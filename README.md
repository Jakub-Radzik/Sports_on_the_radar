# Sports on the radar

## Run app locally:

1. Use node version defined in `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` file
2. If you use `nvm` to manage node versions run `nvm use` to use the correct node version
3. Being in the root directory of the project run `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. Run `yarn start:backend` to start the backend server
5. Run `yarn start:frontend` to start the frontend server
6. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser


## Additional info:
- I did not want to play with `.env` files, so I hardcoded it in config files, where `.env` files should be readed
